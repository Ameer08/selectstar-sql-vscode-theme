# SelectStar

SelectStar is a focused VS Code theme collection designed for **SQL readability** and **data-heavy workflows**.

It prioritises calm surfaces, clear hierarchy and restrained accents, with visual cues inspired by familiar tools such as **SSMS**, while feeling at home in modern editors.

The goal is simple: reduce visual noise so you can read, reason and query for long sessions without fatigue.
